# Boost Chat Server
A simple chat server implemented in boost


## About
Although simple, the server has some important features that allow you to keep track of server uptime, user logs and other stats, as well as making it straightforward to add new ones. In the future this project should be further expanded to support in-game communtications serving as a small network between the clients and the host.

## Use CMake to build
It's easy. Get [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) for your platform, open it, and copy-past the path at which the clone of this project resides. Select a directory in which a project should be built, usually it's "..path-to-project/build", and hit 'generate'. This will put all of the sources, headers and libraries into a single project using compiler of your own liking. Now you just have to open that project in IDE and hit 'build'.
